                <p className="about-page__paragraph"> The platform where you can borrow toys from your neighbours, and lend out toys that your kids play with only sometimes.
                    Do your kids love new toys, but you donâ€™t love the ever-growing mountain of vehicles, dolls and games spilling out of your cupboards?
                    We have created a platform were you can connect with like-minded parents to lend toys to each other, creating a large toy library for your children.
                </p>
